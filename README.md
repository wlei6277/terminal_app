2. The app then loops through cat database, recording if each cat meets the criteria of the user.

3. The app filters all cats which do not match on mandatory criteria.

4. The app then ranks any remaining cats according to how many of the user's criteria are met.

5. If there is at least one cat that meets the user's mandatory criteria, the user is presented with the eligible cats in order of closest match. 

6. User can choose to adopt or not adopt a cat. 

7. If the user does not choose to adopt any matching cats, a message prints to the screen.

8. If there are no cats that match the user's mandatory criteria a message prints to the screen informing the user of this.
